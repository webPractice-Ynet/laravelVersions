Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1

    - Installation request for laravel/framework v5.0.16 -> satisfiable by laravel/framework[v5.0.16].
  
    - laravel/framework v5.0.16 requires ext-mcrypt * -> the requested PHP extension mcrypt is missing from your system.

  To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
 
    - C:\xampp\php\php.ini
  You can also run `php --ini` inside terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
